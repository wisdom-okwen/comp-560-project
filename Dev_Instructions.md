# comp-560-project
### TODO immediately
- **Everyone create their own branch with username**
- **Make sure to pull from main before committing anything to avoid conflicts**
- **Install the required packes and check out the code**
    - Creating virtual environment: `python -m venv Virtual_Environment`
    - **<u>Activating virtual environment:</u> `source Virtual_Environment/Scripts/activate`**
        - Once you activate the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by running `deactivate`, and all the packages you downloaded will still be there when you reactivate again
    - Install packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
        - Alternative method (all package requirements should be in <u>requirements.txt</u>, but try this if you have a problem):
            - Install packages: `pip install ipykernel numpy pandas torch sklearn`
    - Select the <i>Virtual_Environment</i> kernel inside the <u>ipynb</u>
### Gameplan
- \* Create plan for final project here \*

### Questions
- How do we keep dependencies consistent across our devices?
