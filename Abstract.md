# Abstract: Predicting Bank Customer Churn Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning  

Customer churn refers to the process of customers leaving a service or discontinuing their relationship with a business. This study develops both a traditional machine learning classifier and a deep learning model to predict customer churn based on past customer data, including demographic details, insurance history, and engagement metrics.  

Prior to model training, the dataset is preprocessed using one-hot encoding for categorical features. Our machine learning classifier, implemented with Scikit-learn, achieves a mean cross-validation accuracy of 90.17% on test data. For our deep learning approach, we employ PyTorch and structure the data into tensors for efficient computation.  

The neural network consists of seven layers, including three trainable layers using `torch.nn.Linear()`. The first hidden layer has 64 neurons, followed by a ReLU activation function (`torch.nn.ReLU()`) to capture non-linear patterns. A dropout layer (`torch.nn.Dropout(0.3)`) mitigates overfitting by randomly deactivating 30% of neurons. Subsequent layers reduce the neuron count from 64 to 32 before outputting a final prediction layer with two neurons.  

The model is optimized using the Adam optimizer and trained with binary cross-entropy loss. After 50 epochs with a batch size of 32, our deep learning model achieves an average predictive accuracy of approximately 91%. These results highlight the effectiveness of both machine learning and deep learning approaches in predicting customer churn, providing valuable insights for financial institutions aiming to improve customer retention strategies.

# Old Abstract

Customer churn (or just churn) is a term that signifies the process of a customer leaving a service or discontinuing their relationship with a business. In this study, we develop a simple machine learning classification algorithm and a deep-learning model to predict churn using past customer data, including demographic details, insurance history, and engagement metrics. Before training the models on our data, we preprocessed our data, using one-hot encoding for categorical features. One-hot encoding is a strategy that maps a discrete number of values from a categorical feature to a bitstring. The machine learning algorithm uses sklearn and was able to predict churn in the test data with a mean cross-validation score of 90.17%. The deep-learning neural network model is implemented using pytorch, for which we reshaped the data into tensors. To apply linear transformation and create our first layer, we used the torch.nn.Linear() method with 64 neurons. Our second layer uses a ReLU activation function (torch.nn.ReLU()) to introduce non-linearity into the model, helping it learn more complex patterns. We then set 30% of the neurons to zero to prevent overfitting using torch.nn.Dropout(). At this point we add another 3 layers using the same process, but with the hidden linear transformation layer reducing the number of neurons from 64 to 32. Lastly, an output dense layer is added to reduce the neurons from 32 to 2. This model has 7 layers if you count all the trainable layers and activation functions, 3 of which are trainable layers (those using Linear()). The model is optimized using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. After 50 epochs with a bin size of 32, the model achieves a high level of predictive accuracy (about 91% on average).
